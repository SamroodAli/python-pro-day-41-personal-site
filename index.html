        I am a an auditing student turned rogue.
        I love learned new things and
        what attracted me to programming is how much cool it is
        to build something and ship it to people.
        That is the definition of joy for me.
        I am about to take the Microverse full stack developer course to realise that dream.
        I am also going to be learning algorithms from Algoexpert, system designs from System Expert.
        I will spend the rest of my time if available on frontendmasters because I love the passion the instructors
        bring to their courses.
        It adds beauty and color to my world of programming
        and brings me a lot of inspiration to be like them.
        I too want to teach programming to the next generation
        when I am done with my journey.
